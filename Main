#Problem: Given an input of a string, determine the most common character in the string:
#Need a loop to run through the string.
#Loop needs to count each letter, then print the letters with the count.

#Get input from user:
words = input("Input the string to evaluate for the most common character:")

#Print result:
print("You entered: ",words)

#Set blank Dictionary:
count = {}

#Write Loop for all characters in lower case: If you want it to not be case specific, remove all the .lower() from the loop.
for x in words:
    if x in count:
        count[x.lower()] = count[x.lower()] + 1
    else:
        count[x.lower()] = 1
#Delete out the blank key, remove line if you want spaces left in:
count.pop(" ")

#F-String (Formatted String) for results of key (character):
print(f"The index of all characters is: {count}")
print("The most common character is: \"" + max(count, key = count.get) + "\"")

#Variable for maximum count of key (character):
all_values = count.values()
max_value = max(all_values)
print(f"Maximum Value:  \"{max_value}\"")
